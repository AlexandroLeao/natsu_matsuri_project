# Natsu Matsuri Prototype Project

 The Natsu-Matsuri Prototype project is a simple and basic application for financial transaction control, offering a user-friendly and intuitive interface for users to register and view transactions in an organized manner. This project is a web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to track their income and expenses by adding items and their corresponding values and types (income or expense) to a table.
 
## Step-by-Step Development

1. Create the basic structure of the HTML file (`index.html`) with the necessary elements such as headings, main section, input fields, and table structure.
2. Add CSS styles to the HTML file (`style.css`) to define the layout, colors, and typography of the application.
3. Write JavaScript code (`script.js`) to handle user interactions and manipulate the data.
4. Implement the functionality to add new items to the table by retrieving values from the input fields and updating the table dynamically.
5. Create functions to calculate and display the total income, total expenses, and overall balance based on the items in the table.
6. Enable the deletion of items from the table by implementing a function to remove items from the data and update the table accordingly.
7. Store the items in the browser's local storage to persist the data even after refreshing the page.
8. Load the items from the local storage when the page is loaded to display the previously added items.
9. Test the application thoroughly to ensure all features are working correctly.
10. Create a README file (`README.md`) with instructions on how to install, use, and contribute to the project.
11. Add any necessary images or assets to the project, such as the favicon (`favicon.ico`).

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder.
3. Double-click on the `index.html` file to open it in your web browser.

## Usage

1. Upon opening the application, you will see a section displaying the total income, total expenses, and overall balance.
2. Below the totals section, there is a form to add new items. Fill in the product description, quantity, value, and select the type (income or expense).
3. Click the "Incluir" (Include) button to add the item to the table.
4. The table displays the product description, quantity, value, type, and a delete button for each item.
5. To delete an item, click the trash icon button in the corresponding row.
6. The totals section will update automatically with the new values.
